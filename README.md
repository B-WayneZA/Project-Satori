# Project-Satori
 Inspired by the Japanese concept of sudden enlightenment, Satori embodies the essence of instant discovery and clarity. This project is dedicated to bringing moments of revelation in the most unexpected ways. Stay tuned to see what unfolds.

"Project Satori" is a shop-the-look app designed to scan an image of a person, isolate clothing pieces, and find where they are sold online using the Google Custom Search API. The app aims to provide accurate search results and a seamless user experience (UX).

### Key Features and Objectives

1. **Core Functionality**:
    - Utilizes image processing (OpenCV) and machine learning for object detection to isolate clothing items from uploaded images.
    - Integrates with the Google Custom Search API to search for identified clothing items across online stores.
2. **User Experience (UX)**:
    - Focuses on a clean, responsive UI suitable for web and mobile (Ionic).
    - Potential features include virtual try-on, style recommendations based on trends and user preferences, and social media integration for sharing looks.
3. **Technical Stack**:
    - Frontend: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (Ionic framework for mobile).
    - Backend: Node.js or Python (Django/Flask) for server-side logic and API integration.
    - Database: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or MySQL for storing user data and cached results.
    - Image Processing: Uses OpenCV for image manipulation and feature extraction.
4. **Architecture**:
    - Follows a scalable and reliable architecture design to handle image processing, API requests, and user interactions efficiently.
    - Cloud hosting (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) considered for scalability and reliability.
